The company’s main mission is to provide a transparent, hi-tech and personalised wealth management service for individuals [(Nest Wealth, 2020)](https://www.nestwealth.com/about). The CEO of Nest Wealth, Randy Cass, has 20 years of experience in the wealth management industry managing large portfolios and making them successful. During his portfolio management career; he realised and grabbed the opportunity that targeted the Canadian investor pool who were being charged high fees for financial products. Hence, the organisation has been attracting its’ target market by charging investors based on the provided service value instead of a percentage from their total portfolio [(Vukelic, 2019)](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/scotiabank-digital-banking-lab/canada-fintech/wealth-management/nest-wealth/).
