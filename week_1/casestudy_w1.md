---

## Overview and Origin of Nest Wealth 

Nest Wealth was founded by Randy Cass in 2014, which is Canada’s first SaaS based digital wealth management platform with robo-advisors for individuals that are looking to invest long term effectively and easily. The company’s main mission is to provide a transparent, hi-tech and personalised wealth management service for individuals [(Nest Wealth, 2020)](https://www.nestwealth.com/about). The CEO of Nest Wealth, Randy Cass, has 20 years of experience in the wealth management industry managing large portfolios and making them successful. During his portfolio management career; he realised and grabbed the opportunity that targeted the Canadian investor pool who were being charged high fees for financial products. Hence, the organisation has been attracting its’ target market by charging investors based on the provided service value instead of a percentage from their total portfolio [(Vukelic, 2019)](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/scotiabank-digital-banking-lab/canada-fintech/wealth-management/nest-wealth/).


Nest Wealth raised its’ $1.5 million fund through seed funding from Metroland Media in August 5th, 2015. Seed funding is the money or funds collected in order to start the business [(Crunchbase, 2020)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nest-wealth/company_financials). In 2017, National bank of Canada invested $6 million as a strategic minority investment along with signing commercial agreements between the two corporations. The following agreement included National Bank using Nest Wealth’s innovative investment technologies in order to boost their digital platforms for providing better client benefits [(National Bank, 2017)](https://www.nbc.ca/en/about-us/news/news-room/press-releases/2017/20170421-National-Bank-Minority-Investment-Nest-Wealth.html). Moreover, National Bank and Nest Wealth signed a minority equity investment and long-term service agreement, which, has been the biggest deal signed with $50 million fund collected. Also, the recent deal signed builds a strong foundation for the start-up to work with retail wealth business as well as NBIN in order to build great client digital experiences for the entire industry. Lastly, it shows traditional financial institutes taking innovative approaches by partnering and investing in a pioneering start-up which requires great degree of trust and flexibility [(Nest Wealth, 2020)](https://www2.nestwealth.com/today-is-a-big-day-in-the-history-of-nest-wealth/).

## Nest Wealth's Business Activities

Nest Wealth intends to change the rigid traditional landscape of financial institutions that charge high fees to clients as they will now be competing in lower cost environment. Moreover, Nest Wealth highly deems the importance of client experience by providing easy access to high-level finance tools that help them reach their financial goals regardless of their location or wealth [(Soloshchuk, 2019)](https://wealth.insart.com/nest-wealth/#:~:text=Main%20technologies,end%20was%20written%20in%20AngularJS.). Hence, investors will have full access to flexible, transparent, low-cost financial investment tools unlike in traditional financial institutions such as banks. Currently, Nest Wealth has four platforms for its clienteles; *direct-to-customer platform, Nest Wealth Plus, Nest Wealth Pro, Nest Wealth at work*. In a **direct-to-consumer platform**, the organisation has a trustee obligation towards its client making decisions with their best interests in mind. On the other hand, **Nest Wealth pro** provides traditional financial institutes and advisors the same technologies robo-advisors use in order to expand their capability and efficiency unlike the paper-based industry [(Collie, 2017)](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/industry-news/nest-wealth-and-national-bank-expand-partnership/). Additionally, **Nest Wealth Plus** is a solution platform where financial advisors refer their clients to Nest Wealth. It has incorporated the Razor Logic Systems into this platform as it acquired Razor Plan; one of Canada’s foremost financial planning software solutions. The following software allowed financial advisors to speedily evaluate client wants and needs accurately and generated a plan for them within fifteen minutes. Hence, Nest Wealth has been working with clients of Razor Plan which includes Canada’s big six banks, freelancer financial advisors and investment firms [(Cision, 2019)](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nest-wealth-acquires-razor-logic-systems-becoming-first-b2b-digital-wealth-management-platform-to-offer-both-professional-investment-solutions-and-sophisticated-financial-planning-capabilities-879777068.html). Lastly, **Nest Wealth at Work**, is a group of RRSP solution that is provided free to employers to provide their employee s with retire investment programs [(Collie, 2017)](https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/industry-news/nest-wealth-and-national-bank-expand-partnership/).


Nest Wealth functions differently than its competitors such as Wealthsimple and Questrade that both offer robo-advisor portfolios with human customer service. It charges a monthly capped fee of $80 per month or $960 per year rather than the standard percentage on assets. On the other hand, most digital wealth management organisations charge percentage between 0.35 and 0.5 which would be ideal for starting investors with smaller portfolios as traditional financial banks usually charge up to 2 per cent. However, Nest wealth has a competitive advantage over its’ competitors with affluent investors that have portfolios of $250,000 and above. `For example, if an individual’s portfolio is $500,000 with 0.40 percent charge, the management fees would be $2000 per year which exceeds the capped management fee of $960 per year charged by Nest Wealth.` Hence, comparatively, larger portfolio amount means greater monetary advantages for Nest Wealth’s clients [(Engen, 2018)](https://boomerandecho.com/nest-wealth-robo-investing-solution-for-affluent-investors/). 


Main technologies that Nest Wealth uses are a mixture of relational and NoSQL databases. The organisation needs a combination of both in order to store predictable and structured data as well as scale flexible and rapid growth of data [(Johnson, 2016](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/when-to-consider-a-nosql-vs-relational-database). The software tooling is done through Node.js which is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment which is outstanding for run high data concentrated real-time applications on various shared devices efficiently [(Kaneriya, 2020)](https://www.simform.com/what-is-node-js/). Moreover, AngularJS was used for front-end which is being switched over to Angular 6. This would allow their developers to develop toolkits and strategies without worrying about front or back end capacity. Additionally, Nest Wealth has invested in internal tools like comprehensive design systems, that help build and design prototype and applications quickly. Lastly, managing integrations, deployment and continuous delivery is done through Jenkins [(Soloshchuk, 2019)](https://wealth.insart.com/nest-wealth/#:~:text=Main%20technologies,end%20was%20written%20in%20AngularJS).

## Wealth Management Landscape

Nest Wealth falls under the domain called wealth management. The wealth management industry, like any other industry, has evolved through time. During the 70s and 80s most Canadians invested their money through bank deposits and Canada saving bonds which had high interest rates. However, as the interest rates began to decline over the decades and mutual funds gained rapid popularity for their potential higher returns. Additionally, it was the first-time average Canadians could invest small amounts into diversified baskets which was professionally managed. Through the popularity of mutual funds, investors became well aware about the advantages of professional wealth or portfolio management and wanted its benefits [(Evolution, 2020)](https://evolutionsolutions.ca/the-evolution-of-investment-management-in-canada/). 


During the past 5 to 10 years, the wealth management space in Canada has been disrupted by robo-advisors that are lower in cost and transparent due to rapid technological advancements [(Lawther, 2020)](https://international-adviser.com/robo-vs-financial-advice-battle-of-the-canadian-wealth-market/). Digital wealth management companies such as *Wealthsimple* has recently raised up to $100 million and is one of the biggest investments made to a FinTech company in Canada; which has attracted millennials’ attention due to its lower management costs for smaller portfolios [(Pelletier, 2019)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/evolution-canadas-wealth-management-industry-martin-pelletier-cfa/). Moreover, with the changes in investor demographics and consumer behaviour, robo-advisors have been popular due to its flexible, hyper personalisation, competitive pricing and 24/7 availability attributes [(EY, 2019)](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/44-of-canadians-plan-to-switch-wealth-management-firms-in-the-next-three-years-875583493.html). However, even with its fair share of digital disruption, 90% of Canadian investors chose the *big five Canadian banks* to manage their wealth as opposed to only 35% of American investors dealt with 5 biggest banks of USA [(Pelletier, 2018)](https://financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/why-canadas-wealth-management-sector-is-ripe-for-disruption). Nevertheless, Nest Wealth has been working with the big banks of Canada as well as partnered with National Bank to incorporate their innovative technologies to provide their clients with lower costs and better digital customer experience [(National Bank, 2017)](https://www.nbc.ca/en/about-us/news/news-room/press-releases/2017/20170421-National-Bank-Minority-Investment-Nest-Wealth.html).
