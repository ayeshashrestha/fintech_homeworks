The CEO of Nest Wealth, Randy Cass, has 20 years of experience in the wealth management industry managing large portfolios and making them successful. During his portfolio management career; he realised and grabbed the opportunity that targeted the Canadian investor pool who were being charged high fees for financial products. Hence, the organisation has been attracting its’ target market by charging investors based on the provided service value instead of a percentage from their total portfolio [(Vukelic, 2019)](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/scotiabank-digital-banking-lab/canada-fintech/wealth-management/nest-wealth/).


Nest Wealth raised its’ $1.5 million fund through seed funding from Metroland Media in August 5th, 2015. Seed funding is the money or funds collected in order to start the business [(Crunchbase, 2020)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nest-wealth/company_financials). In 2017, National bank of Canada invested $6 million as a strategic minority investment along with signing commercial agreements between the two corporations. The following agreement included National Bank using Nest Wealth’s innovative investment technologies in order to boost their digital platforms for providing better client benefits [(National Bank, 2017)](https://www.nbc.ca/en/about-us/news/news-room/press-releases/2017/20170421-National-Bank-Minority-Investment-Nest-Wealth.html). Moreover, National Bank and Nest Wealth signed a minority equity investment and long-term service agreement, which, has been the biggest deal signed with $50 million fund collected.
